# Studio Management System — Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform

## Overview
I designed and developed a full-stack multi-tenant SaaS/ERP platform for a multi-branch dance school organization. The system replaces spreadsheet-based workflows by centralizing student records, scheduling, financial tracking, and reporting into a single web application.

The platform is used operationally by staff across different locations.
